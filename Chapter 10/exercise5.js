// Practice exercise 10.5
// Use querySelector() to enable single element selection:
// 1. Create another simple HTML file.
// 2. Create four HTML elements adding the same class to each. They can be
// different tag names as long as they have the class within the element
// attribute.
// 3. Add some content within each element so you can distinguish between them.
// 4. Within a script element, use querySelector() to select the first occurrence
// of the elements with that class and store it in a variable. If there is more than
// one matching result in querySelector(), it will return the first one.
// 5. Output the element into the console.

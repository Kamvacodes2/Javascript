// Practice exercise 10.6
// Use querySelectorAll() to select all matching elements in an HTML file:
// 1. Create an HTML file and add four HTML elements, adding the same class to
// each one.
// 2. Add some content within each element so you can distinguish between them.
// 3. Within a script element, use QuerySelectorAll() to select all the matching
// occurrences of the elements with that class and store them in a variable.
// 4. Output all the elements into the console, first as an array and then looping
// through them to output them one by one.

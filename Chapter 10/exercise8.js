// Practice exercise 10.8
// Creating custom attributes: using an array of names, the following code will update
// the element's HTML, adding HTML code using the data from the array. The items
// within the array will be output to the page as HTML code. The user will be able to
// click the page elements and they will display the page element attribute values.

// 1. Create an array of names. You can add as many as you want—all the string
// values will be output onto the page within a table.
// 2. Select the page elements as JavaScript objects.
// 3. Add a function and also invoke that function within the JavaScript code. The
// function can be called build() as it will be building the page content. Within
// the build function, you will be setting up the HTML in a table.
// 4. Create a table named html, and within the tags, loop through the contents of
// the array and output the results into the html table.
// 5. Add a class called box to one of the cells that has the index value of the item
// from the array, adding the same class to the elements for each additional
// row.
// 6. As you create the HTML for the elements within the tr element, create an
// attribute called data-row in the main row element that includes the index
// value of the item from the array. In addition, add another attribute within the
// element called data-name that will contain the text output.
// 7. Within the attribute of the same tr element, also add onclick to invoke a
// function named getData passing the current element object as this into the
// function parameter.
// 8. Add the table of HTML code to the page.
// 9. Create a function named getData that will be invoked once the HTML tr
// elements are clicked. Once the tr element is clicked, use getAttribute to get
// the attribute values of the row value and the contents of the text output and
// store them in different variables.
// 10. Using the values in the attributes stored in the preceding step, output the
// values into the message element on the page.
// 11. Once the user clicks the element on the page, it will display the details
// coming from the element attributes within the element with the id of
// message.

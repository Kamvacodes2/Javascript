'use strict'

// Practice exercise 10.9
// Try an alternative way to implement similar logic to Practice exercise 10.7. Use the
// following HTML code as a template for this exercise, and add the contents of the
// script element:
// Take the following steps:
// 1. Select all the page buttons into a JavaScript object.
// 2. Loop through each button, and create a function within the button scope
// called output.
// 3. Within the output() function, add a console.log() method that outputs
// the current object's textContent. You can reference the current parent object
// using the this keyword.
// 4. As you loop through the buttons attach an event listener that when clicked
// invokes the output() function.

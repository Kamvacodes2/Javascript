'use strict'

// Practice exercise 10.4
// Select all matching page elements using the class name of the element.
// 1. Create a simple HTML file to work on.
// 2. Add three HTML elements adding the same class to each. You can use
// different tags as long as the same element class is included. Add some
// content within each element so you can distinguish between them.
// 3. Add a script element to your file, and within it select the page elements by
// class name. Assign the resulting HTMLCollection values to a variable.
// 4. You can use an index value to select the individual HTMLCollection items,
// just as you would for array items. Starting with an index of 0, select one
// of the page elements with the class name and output the element into the
// console.

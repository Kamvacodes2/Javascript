<!-- Specifying events with HTML -->
<!-- 
    <p id="unique" onclick="magic()">Click here for magic!</p>
    As soon as you click on the paragraph, the function magic() will be triggered.
    downsides: you can only
    specify one event this way, and you cannot change the event dynamically either

    Specifying events with JavaScript:
    document.getElementById("unique").onclick = function() { magic(); };
 -->


<!-- Specifying events with event listeners
    we can specify multiple functions for the same event
    document.getElementById("unique").addEventListener("click", magic);
    Please note that we are leaving out the parentheses behind the magic function here.
    We cannot send in parameters like this.

    If that is something you have to do, you'd
    have to wrap the functionality in an anonymous function, like this:

    document.getElementById("unique").addEventListener("click", function(){ magic(arg1, arg2) });
-->


<!-- The onload event handler -->

<!-- window.onload = function() { -->
<!-- whatever needs to happen after the page loads goes here
   } -->


<!-- The load event fires at the
end of the document loading process. -->

<!-- document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", (e) => {
    console.log(e);

You cannot combine addEventListener() and the HTML
by using them together.

. If you need two events to happen when the DOM is loaded, you will
need two addEventListener() calls in your JavaScript.
-->


<!-- Mouse event handlers -->

<!-- There are different mouse event handlers. Mouse events are actions of the mouse.
These are the ones we have:


• ondblclick: when the mouse is double-clicked
• onmousedown: when the mouse clicks on top of an element without the click being released
• onmouseup: when the mouse click on top of an element is released
• onmouseenter: when the mouse moves onto an element
• onmouseleave: when the mouse leaves an element and all of its children
• onmousemove: when the mouse moves over an element
• onmouseout: when the mouse leaves an individual element
• onmouseover: when the mouse hovers over an element -->



<!-- The event target property -->
<!-- 
<!doctype html>
<html>

<body>
    <button type="button" onclick="triggerSomething()">Click</button>
    <script>
        function triggerSomething() {
            console.dir(event.target);
        }
    </script>
</body>

</html> -->

<!-- In the above case, event.target is the button element. In the console, the button element
and all its properties will be logged, including potential siblings and parents -->


<!-- A use case where parent properties can come in handy is in the case of HTML forms,
where there are multiple input fields and a button. A button in a form would often
have the form as its direct parent. Via this parent, data from the input fields can be
fetched -->

<!-- <!doctype html>
<html>

<body>
    <div id="welcome">Hi there!</div>
    <form>
        <input type="text" name="firstname" placeholder="First name" />
        <input type="text" name="lastname" placeholder="Last name" />
        <input type="button" onclick="sendInfo()" value="Submit" />
    </form>
    <script>
        function sendInfo() {
            let p = event.target.parentElement;
            message("Welcome " + p.firstname.value + " " + p.lastname.
                value);
        }
        function message(m) {
            document.getElementById("welcome").innerHTML = m;
        }
    </script>
</body>

</html> -->
